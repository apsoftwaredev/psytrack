		<key>What does this application do?</key>
		<string>Description of the Application:
psyTrack is an application designed to help clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and other clinicians and trainees to track their training hours for practicum, internship, or other licensing or statistical purposes.  It allows clinicians to keep a record of services provided to clients, including tests administered and types of treatments provided.  It allows clinicians to track their continuing education hours and classes needed for certifications or degrees.  It allows clinicians to easily track additional user defined demographic variables of their clients and other clinicians, which is useful for licensing and therapist matching.  It allows clinicians to keep a record of their own and other clinicians’ previous employment, publications, license information, and other curriculum vitae information.  It allows the clinician to easily track client referrals to other clinicians.  It is integrated with the Apple Address book to allow connection with and importing existing contacts.  It is also integrated with the Apple Calendar to enable the clinician to easily schedule clients using a secure client code.  It also provides a complete interface to the US FDA drug database, which links to downloadable pdfs containing drug labeling (package inserts), medication guides, and other FDA documents related to each drug.  It allows the clinician to track and keep notes on the medications prescribed to clients and the side effects.  It allows the clinician to keep statistical data on the disorders he/she is treating, and the outcome of treatment.  The database is encrypted with and the app also features an in-app locking screen for additional security.  It is iCloud enabled, which allows syncing of the database across devices.  The application is designed for iPad, iPhone, and iPod with iOS 5.0 or higher.  It also provides additional tools such as current age and test age calculator and height, weight, and blood pressure tracker with applicable US/Metric conversions.  The time tracking tools allow you to specify a start and stop time, use a stopwatch, record breaks, and add/subtract additional time to compute total service time. </string>

		<key>How secure is the data? What if I loose my phone?</key>
		<string>The database files on the device are protected with industry standard encryption protections built into the device and should be protected from being accessed while your phone is locked.  The data sent over the internet to the iCloud server is encrypted as it is sent across the internet.  In addition to the standard encryption measures, the program generates a unique random key (a long random string of characters that would take forever to guess) when you install the application.  To access your unique key, the program unlocks it using a one-way hash algorithm combined with your login pass code.   The key is also protected using 256 bit AES encryption while in storage.  The key is then used to encrypt data in individual fields with potentially sensitive data, and decrypt them at when you access the data.  The data in these fields are stored and transferred over iCloud to you other device as an encrypted data blobs.  The passcodes would be difficult to recover if lost and it would be difficult to decrypt any encrypted data.  If you lock your phone and the app, it would take a long time to try all 9999 numbers, and the phone and app lock after a short number of failed attempts.  If you use a different number for the phone and in-App locking, this may increase the amount of time that may be needed (lower the likelihood of a correct guess). This protects the data from unsophisticated attacks if you happen to lose your phone; however, governments, organizations, and individuals with more resources may still be able to crack the code or find weaknesses, as is true of any encrypted or electronic data. There is also an unlikely chance that the passcode could be guessed correctly.  Therefore with this in mind, you should also use discretion and caution when entering information into the database.  It would be best to not store personally identifying information related to clients, such as names or social security numbers, potentially damaging information, etc., even though it is encrypted when locked.  Try using an ID code or initials instead client names and store the names with the ID codes non-electronically.  You could also come up with a system for changing the birthdates using your own code.   If you use iCloud, choose a strong password.  Try not to choose passcodes that are easy to guess, like 1111, lucky or significant numbers, or your birthday.  It is a good idea to keep your phone locked when not using the app.  If you loose your phone or it is stolen and you have it set up, you could also try to remotely wipe it.</string>

		<key>Why are some of the “Done” buttons disabled on the forms?  </key>
		<string>The done buttons will disable and you will not be able to save the data in the form if certain required fields are missing or if they contain invalid data.  For example, when adding a clinician, the done button is disabled until something is entered in the first and last name fields.</string>

		<key>Who developed this?</key>
		<string>The application was designed and developed by a current clinical practicum student in a doctoral level graduate program.  The developer has a Masters degree in Psychology and has a background in MIS and IT.  He has developed successfull database applications for small businesses and State government.  He is owner of Psychweb LLC, a company which develops technology for use in clinical practice.</string>
