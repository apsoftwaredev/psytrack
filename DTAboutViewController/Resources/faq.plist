		<key>How long does it take to receive a response to my email?</key>
		<string>I am currently a one-man operation and I get many emails daily. I am not sure how many people are going to use this app and have questions.  I will try my best to your answer emails promptly if they pertain to the program. Feedback is always appreciated whether it is positive and encouraging, or by helping by pointing out areas that could be improved.
I try my best to answer every support question.

For support issues, email response time varies. I do try my best to answer as promptly as possible. If I don’t respond within a week, feel free to remind us with another email. I will try my best and I truly do care. </string>

		<key>Why are some of the “Done” buttons disabled on the forms?  </key>
		<string>The done buttons will disable and you will not be able to save the data in the form if certain required fields are missing or if they contain invalid data.  For example, when adding a clinician, the done button is disabled until something is entered in the first and last name fields.</string>

		<key>How do I back up the data?</key>
		<string>The database is backed up when you back up your device software in iTunes or iCloud.  You can set up iCloud to automatically create secure backups of your device software.  iCloud is nice because if you somehow loose your device or have a fire and all your hardware is destroyed, you can pick up where you left off with the last back up.</string>

		<key>What are the relevant HIPPA rules regarding client information?</key>
		<string>Please review the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules before entering any client information into this app.  The client information in this app is intended to be used mainly for personal statistical tracking purposes, not the primary record keeping. It does allow you to keep a phone number of current clients.   Consider deleting this information if it is not necessary to it carry with you, or only using this if you are sure the device is in a secure location.  The idea behind storing the phone number was that if you had to carry the phone number with you for some reason you could keep it in a more secure place than a piece of paper or address book (which can be accessed by other apps).  It is also recommended that you use a more secure telephone line than your cell phone for voice calls.  The data in the database is encrypted when the phone is locked.  The app lock screen hides the app controls and data from view when the phone is unlocked.  For additional security, it is recommended that the information you enter related to clients should be completely de-identified, which includes id numbers that can be traced to clients.  Consider also disabling the automatic joining of unknown WIFI networks in the device WIFI settings.http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/summary/index.html“De-Identified Health Information. There are no restrictions on the use or disclosure of de-identified health information.14 De-identified health information neither identifies nor provides a reasonable basis to identify an individual. There are two ways to de-identify information; either: (1) a formal determination by a qualified statistician; or (2) the removal of specified identifiers of the individual and of the individual’s relatives, household members, and employers is required, and is adequate only if the covered entity has no actual knowledge that the remaining information could be used to identify the individual.15 “The developers will not be responsible for any compromising of data due to failure to follow these recommendations.</string>

		<key>How is the address book data used?</key>
		<string>If you choose to allow the app to connect to your address book the app can create a link from the clinicians in your database to contacts in your address book.   This is intended to save time when entering and managing clinicians who are already in your address book.  It is optional feature.  Only the name and an identifier number is stored in the app, the rest is kept in your address book database.  If you have iCloud enabled the records in the app database are synched between devices and is encrypted as it goes over the internet and through iCloud. If you choose to synch between your devices using iCloud the data is protected and encrypted between devices using your iCloud password.   No information from the database is intentionally sent off the device to the developers or to third parties.  The only information that is sent to the developers is a de-identified device token if you choose to accept push notifications when you install the app, which is the standard way of sending push notifications through the apple push notification service.  It is recommended that you de-identify the client data for additional security and keep your phone locked with a password in order to encrypt the data on the device.  If you activate the in-app lock screen , it works like a screen saver and blocks the app controls and data from view when your phone is unlocked and the app is running.  The app lock screen helps secure the data from being viewed by people you authorize to use your phone (e.g., when your partner is looking at your pictures or checking your text messages).  You should lock your phone for more complete encryption protection when your phone is not being used.  For additional security, consider disabling automatic joining of unknown WIFI networks in the WIFI settings.
