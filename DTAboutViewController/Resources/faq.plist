		<key>What does this application do?</key>
		<string>Description of the Application:
psyTrack is an application designed to help clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and other clinicians and trainees to track their training hours for practicum, internship, or other licensing or statistical purposes.  It allows clinicians to keep a record of services provided to clients, including tests administered and types of treatments provided.  It allows clinicians to track their continuing education hours and classes needed for certifications or degrees.  It allows clinicians to easily track additional user defined demographic variables of their clients and other clinicians, which is useful for licensing and therapist matching.  It allows clinicians to keep a record of their own and other clinicians’ previous employment, publications, license information, and other curriculum vitae information.  It allows the clinician to easily track client referrals to other clinicians.  It is integrated with the Apple Address book to allow connection with and importing existing contacts.  It is also integrated with the Apple Calendar to enable the clinician to easily schedule clients using a secure client code.  It also provides a complete interface to the US FDA drug database, which links to downloadable pdfs containing drug labeling (package inserts), medication guides, and other FDA documents related to each drug.  It allows the clinician to track and keep notes on the medications prescribed to clients and the side effects.  It allows the clinician to keep statistical data on the disorders he/she is treating, and the outcome of treatment.  The database is encrypted with and the app also features an in-app locking screen for additional security.  It is iCloud enabled, which allows syncing of the database across devices.  The application is designed for iPad, iPhone, and iPod with iOS 5.0 or higher.  It also provides additional tools such as current age and test age calculator and height, weight, and blood pressure tracker with applicable US/Metric conversions.  The time tracking tools allow you to specify a start and stop time, use a stopwatch, record breaks, and add/subtract additional time to compute total service time. </string>

		<key>How long does it take to receive a response to my email?</key>
		<string>I am currently a one-man operation and I get many emails daily. I am not sure how many people are going to use this app and have questions.  I will try my best to your answer emails promptly if they pertain to the program. Feedback is always appreciated whether it is positive and encouraging, or by helping by pointing out areas that could be improved.
I try my best to answer every support question.

For support issues, email response time varies. I do try my best to answer as promptly as possible. If I don’t respond within a week, feel free to remind us with another email. I will try my best and I truly do care. </string>

		<key>How secure is the data? What if I loose my phone?</key>
		<string>If you choose to use iCloud to synch your database between devices, the data sent over the internet to the iCloud server is encrypted as it transverses servers on the internet (see Apple&apos;s privacy and security documentation for iCloud).  In addition to the standard encryption measures, the program generates a unique random key (a long random string of characters that would take forever to guess) when you install the application.  To access your unique key, the program unlocks it using a one-way hash algorithm combined with your login pass code.  Your token and password are used to encrypt data in individual fields with potentially sensitive data, and decrypt them at when you access the data.  The data in these fields are stored and transferred over iCloud to you other device as an encrypted data blobs.    If you lock your phone and the app, it would take a long time to try all 9999 numbers using the app, because the phone and app lock after a short number of failed attempts.  Without access to the source code or possibly more sophisticated hacking of memory allocations, the fields with additional encryption are difficult to decrypt.  It also uses the apple keychain to secure data.  Export restrictions for encryption technology may apply outside the U.S.
If you use a different number for the phone and in-App locking (or disable simple password on your phone), this may increase the amount of time that may be needed (lower the likelihood of a correct guess). This protects the data from unsophisticated attacks if you happen to lose your phone; however, governments, organizations, and individuals with more resources may still be able to crack the code or find weaknesses, as is true of any encrypted or electronic data.   I assume that apple can decrypt the data stored in their servers (the non red fields).  Apple also has access to the source code, so they could write a program using the information in the source code and your device to try every number in a fraction of a second to access the data in the red fields, but this would take an extra step.   The data is stored on your device and the updates are transferred between the devices using iCloud.  

The developer is unable to access your database or your phone over the Internet.  Apple is pretty good about their privacy but they may eventually have to cooperate with court orders (see the Apple documentation).  There is also an unlikely chance that the passcode could be guessed correctly.  Therefore with this in mind, you should also use discretion and caution when entering information into the database.  It should be emphasized that it would be best to not store personally identifying information related to clients, such as names or social security numbers, potentially damaging information, etc., even though it is encrypted when locked.  This app is primarily for statistical tracking purposes.  You can also disable iCloud and only use it on one device or have a separate database on another device.  The fields with the additional encryption are indicated with a red label.

Try using an ID code or initials instead client names and store the names with the ID codes non-electronically.  You could also come up with a system for changing the birthdates using your own code and keep it in your head.   If you use iCloud, choose a strong password.  Try not to choose passcodes that are easy to guess, like 1111, lucky or significant numbers, or your birthday.  It is a good idea to keep your phone locked when not using the app.  If you loose your phone or it is stolen and you have it set up, you could also try to remotely wipe it.  The purpose of the lock screen and additional encryption is just to obscure the data from people who might have access to your phone passcode (like when you give your phone to a family member or friend to look at your pictures) or for additional protection if your phone it is lost or stolen.

		<key>Why are some of the “Done” buttons disabled on the forms?  </key>
		<string>The done buttons will disable and you will not be able to save the data in the form if certain required fields are missing or if they contain invalid data.  For example, when adding a clinician, the done button is disabled until something is entered in the first and last name fields.</string>

	<dict>
		<key>How do I back up the data?</key>
		<string>The database is backed up when you back up your device software in iTunes or iCloud.  You can set up iCloud to automatically create secure backups of your device software.  iCloud is nice because if you somehow loose your device or have a fire and all your hardware is destroyed, you can pick up where you left off with the last back up.</string>
