It allows clinicians to keep a record of their own and other clinicians’ previous employment, publications, license information, and other curriculum vitae information.  It allows the clinician to easily track client referrals to other clinicians.  It is integrated with the Apple Address book to allow connection with and importing existing contacts.  It is also integrated with the Apple Calendar to enable the clinician to easily schedule clients using a secure client code.  It also provides a complete interface to the US FDA drug database, which links to downloadable pdfs containing drug labeling (package inserts), medication guides, and other FDA documents related to each drug.  It allows the clinician to track and keep notes on the medications prescribed to clients and the side effects.  It allows the clinician to keep statistical data on the disorders he/she is treating, and the outcome of treatment.  The database is encrypted with and the app also features an in-app locking screen for additional security.  It is iCloud enabled, which allows syncing of the database across devices.

		<key>How secure is the data? What if I loose my phone?</key>
		<string> If you loose your device, you may be able to remotely wipe the data.  It is also recommended that you be very careful with any information that could identify a client and keep your phone secure.  It is recommended that you use the locking feature built into the device in addition to the in-app lock screen as this adds additional security.  We cannot guarantee that a sophisticated hacker would not be able to access the data even though the client sections are encrypted.  Therefore, it is important to keep the device secure and most of all that you are careful about the information you save.  It is recommended that you not save client names, addresses, or other personally identifying information if you are taking your device out of a secure location.  It is also best not to store potentially damaging or sensitive information electronically or carry such information out of a secure location.   Try using an ID code or initials instead client names and store the names with the ID codes non-electronically.  You could also come up with a system for changing the birthdates using your own code.   If you use iCloud, choose a strong password.  The data transferred over the Internet through iCloud is encrypted.</string>
