Description of the Application:
psyTrack is an application designed to help clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and other clinicians and trainees to track their training hours for practicum, internship, or other licensing or statistical purposes.  It allows clinicians to keep a record of services provided to clients, including tests administered and types of treatments provided.  It allows clinicians to track their continuing education hours and classes needed for certifications or degrees.  It allows clinicians to easily track additional user defined demographic variables of their clients and other clinicians, which is useful for licensing and therapist matching.  It allows clinicians to keep a record of their own and other clinicians’ previous employment, publications, license information, and other curriculum vitae information.  It allows the clinician to easily track client referrals to other clinicians.  It is integrated with the Apple Address book to allow connection with and importing existing contacts.  It is also integrated with the Apple Calendar to enable the clinician to easily schedule clients using a secure client code.  It also provides a complete interface to the US FDA drug database, which links to downloadable pdfs containing drug labeling (package inserts), medication guides, and other FDA documents related to each drug.  It allows the clinician to track and keep notes on the medications prescribed to clients and the side effects.  It allows the clinician to keep statistical data on the disorders he/she is treating, and the outcome of treatment.  The database utilizes encryption for areas related to content about clients and an in-app locking screen for additional security.  It is iCloud enabled, which allows syncing of the database across devices.  The application is designed for iPad, iPhone, and iPod with iOS 5.0 or higher.  It also provides additional tools such as current age and test age calculator and height, weight, and blood pressure tracker with US/Metric conversions.  The time tracking tools allow you to specify a start and stop time, use a stopwatch, record breaks, add/subtract additional time, to compute total service time.
